# 🇱🇰 Romanized Sinhala Hate Speech Detection

This project aims to detect **hate speech in Romanized Sinhala** text using transformer-based deep learning models (e.g., XLM-RoBERTa). It includes both the model training pipeline and inference (prediction) functionality.

## 🔡 Supported Input

The model expects **Romanized Sinhala text**, such as:

- `"umbalata lokuwatma pissu"`
- `"mokada oya karanne"`

The input is automatically tokenized and passed to the model for classification.
